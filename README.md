# Jay's Awesome MVP Game
Minimal viable product demo made with Unreal Engine 4 (binaries only).
I needed a place to distribute downloadable binaries and thought this might work well.

Featuring Unreal Guy on a mysterious island, faced with a devastating countdown timer and the impossible mission of having to collect 20 scary purple objects.

My first ever release of an Unreal Engine Project!
I've followed Mathew Wadstein's excellent [Unreal tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOVfF7PfLbRdVEm0hONTrNQ) about creating a minimal viable product. It brings together all basic concepts from which an interactive experience can be derived. I've added some other magic of my own. Here's a full list of features:

     
    - a button that opens a door (Blueprint relationship) 
    - several HUDs (graphic overlays)
    - a countdown timer
    - a score counter
    - a menu system (start/pause/success/game over)
    - an intro video
    - music and sound effects
    - interactive water ([UIWS](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/97ef36447df7427ca9b46edf1a438731) - free for this month, value $349)

# Download and Install

This repo does not contain the source code, only the releases.
To download, head over to the [releases](Release Archive) and pick the latest build (or any of the previous ones if you prefer).
Un-ZIP the archive to a folder of your choice, then run MVP.exe to play the demo.
These builds are currently Windows 64-bit only. Windows may prevent you from running it. Should this happen, select "show more" and "run anyway".

# How to play

Both controller and keyboard/mouse navigation is supported for movement, however menus only have mouse support right now.

- WASD - navigation
- P or ESC - bring up the Pause Menu
- collect all purple objects before the time runs out
- you can't die or drown (or swim)
- don't walk off the outer edge of the game world
