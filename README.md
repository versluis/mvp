# Jay's Awesome MVP Game
Minimal viable product demo made with Unreal Engine 4 (binaries only).
I needed a place to distribute downloadable binaries and thought this might work well.

Featuring Unreal Guy on a mysterious island, faced with a devastating countdown timer and the impossible mission of having to collect 20 scary purple objects.

My first ever release of an Unreal Engine Project!
