# Jay's Awesome MVP Game
Minimal viable product demo made with Unreal Engine 4 (binaries only).
I needed a place to distribute downloadable binaries and thought this might work well.

Featuring Unreal Guy on a mysterious island, faced with a devastating countdown timer and the impossible mission of having to collect 20 scary purple objects.

As I learn more about Unreal Engine, I'll expand the project.

My first ever release of an Unreal Engine Project!
I've followed Mathew Wadstein's excellent [Unreal tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOVfF7PfLbRdVEm0hONTrNQ) about creating a minimal viable product. It brings together all basic concepts from which an interactive experience can be derived. I've added some other magic of my own. Here's a full list of features:

- a button that opens a door (Blueprint relationship) 
- several HUDs (graphic overlays)
- a countdown timer
- a score counter
- a menu system (start/pause/success/game over)
- an intro video
- music and sound effects
- interactive water ([UIWS](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/97ef36447df7427ca9b46edf1a438731) - free for this month, value $349)

# How to play

Both controller and keyboard/mouse navigation is supported for movement, however menus only have mouse support right now.

- WASD - navigation
- P or ESC - bring up the Pause Menu
- collect all purple objects before the time runs out
- you can't die or drown (or swim)
- don't walk off the outer edge of the game world
